# **App Name**: Diamond City

## Core Features:

- Main Navigation Bar: Display a horizontal navigation bar with links to Home, About, Project, Service and Contact pages.
- Application Menu Trigger: Implement an application menu ('â‹®' icon) that shows a dropdown or modal.
- Application Menu Content: The application menu modal/dropdown will contain links to Career, Blogs, Purpose, Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, and Cookies pages.
- Get in Touch Section: Implement a 'Get in Touch' section in the app menu which contains direct links to Diamond City's Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn pages.
- Page Navigation: All links within the main navigation and app menu should navigate to a separate page when clicked.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A sophisticated medium-dark slate gray (#4A5568) for the primary interactive elements.
- Background color: Black (#000000) for the navigation bar.
- Accent color: A bright and vibrant purple (#BF80FF) to highlight key actions or elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, providing a clean and modern look for all text elements; consider 16px for body text, scaling appropriately for headings.
- Use a minimalist, black-and-white diamond icon for the website logo; the application menu should use a simple '...' (ellipsis) icon.
- Design a responsive layout to ensure the navigation adapts well to different screen sizes.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and hover effects for a polished user experience.
